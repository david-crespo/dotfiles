### TypeScript projects

- When using library code, work to find the actual type declaration files of the library so you can use their types correctly instead of doing things like writing your own types and casting values to them
  - With npm packages in deno, use commands like `ls -la "$(deno info --json | jq -r '.npmCache')/registry.npmjs.org/@package-name/version/"` to figure out where the declaration files live and read them, following the import chain until you find the type definitions
